This is a simple project, playing around with routing and handlebars. As a user, 
you can enter in the textarea, the name of the burger you would like to eat. Once you submit the form the burger is created on the left side of the page with a button reading "Devour!". They can click the button to devour the burger and it will then appear on the right side of the page with a line through the text, indicating it has been eaten. A delete button is then genereated and you can click it to delete the burger that was devoured.
